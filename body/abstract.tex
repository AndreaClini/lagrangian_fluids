\begin{abstract}
In this work, we investigate the phenomenological consequences of general Dark Sectors whose dynamics can be described by a conformal field theory (CFT), deformed by irrelevant operators that describe the interactions with the Standard Model fields~\cite{Chacko:2020zze,Strassler:2008bv,Strassler:2006im,Georgi:2007ek,Georgi:2007si,Grinstein:2008qk,Knapen:2016hky,Borrello:2025hal}. At low energies the CFT flows to a gapped phase~\cite{Randall:1999ee,Rattazzi:2000hs} whose typical scale can be well below the electroweak scale, providing a perfect theoretical target for the present and future intensity frontier experiments~\cite{Costa:2022pxv,Contino:2020tix}. We study neutrino experiments~\cite{Beacham:2019nyx,DUNE:2015lol,Alekhin:2015byh,NuTeV:2001whx,Hyper-Kamiokande:2018ofw}, considering the production of CFT states that then interact with the detector material through deep inelastic scattering (DIS). As a byproduct of our study, we obtain simple expressions for the DIS of general portal interactions making a judicious use of the operator product expansion~\cite{Klehfoth:2022vgx,Hollands:2023txn}.
